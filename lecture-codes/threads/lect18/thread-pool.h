 * Exports a ThreadPool abstraction, which manages a finite pool
 * of worker threads that collaboratively work through a sequence of tasks.
 * As each task is scheduled, the ThreadPool waits for at least
 * one worker thread to be free and then assigns that task to that worker.  
 * Threads are scheduled and served in a FIFO manner, and tasks need to
 * take the form of thunks, which are zero-argument thread routines.
